# :page_facing_up: Commit: Testing Sum Method with Traditional way 
<p>
Right now the test class is functional, but for good programming practice, errors must be handled
with exceptions (try-catch blocks), and not with conditional evaluations. Create tests this way,
with exception handling, as well as polluting the code with try-catch blocks,
it's a lot of work.
It is at this point that the use of a testing framework proves to be useful.</p>
