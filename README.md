# Unit Testing with JUnit

This repository has small tutorials for testing your code. A common and necessary practice for any programmer looking to keep up with the needs of software production.


1. The purpose of software tests :fireworks:

1.1. What are software tests?
A software test is a piece of software, which executes another piece of software. It validates if that code results in the expected state (state testing) or executes the expected sequence of events (behavior testing). :trophy:

1.2. Why are software tests helpful? :bookmark_tabs:
Software unit tests help the developer to verify that the logic of a piece of the program is correct. Running tests automatically helps to identify software regressions introduced by changes in the source code. Having a high test coverage of your code allows you to continue developing features
without having to perform lots of manual tests.
